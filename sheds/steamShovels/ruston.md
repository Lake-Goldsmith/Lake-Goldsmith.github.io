# Ruston

This model 20 SNC (steam navy srane) was manufactured in 1923 by Ruston & Hornsby in Lincoln, England.  
The No.4 was built on an order for a company in India which
fell through, leaving them available for immediate purchase by Australian Portland Cement. It worked there until the 1950s when it was used to build it's replacments, then sat unused until it was donated to Lake Goldsmith in the early 1980s<sup>[1]</sup>

## Controls

From left to right we have main drive direction, winch clutch, slew, main drive throttle, wheel clutch, and rack. At the drivers feet is a break, and behind them is the main drive blow through lever.

### Main Drive Direction

Left most lever, forwards will winch up the bucket or drive forwards when the wheels are engaged, middle is neutral, backwards is reverse.  
Can be used to make even finer throttle adjustment

### Winch clutch

Second lever from the left, backwards is engaged.  
Controls a steam powered piston which actually applies the clutch

### Slew

Third lever from the left, forwards is left, mid is neutral, backwards is right.  
Has a detent to hold it in the mid position

### Main drive throttle

Fourth lever from the left, forwards is open, backwards is neutral  
Has a pin to hold it in neutral

### Wheel clutch

Fifth lever from the left, forwards is engaged, backwards is disengaged.  
Moves a dog clutch to connect the main drive to the wheels

### Rack

The far right white lever  
Forwards moves the dipper arm out, mid is neutral, back moves in, and racking the dipper arm all the way out opens the bucket.  

### Break

At the main driver's feet is the winch break. It has a pin to hold it engaged

## Engines

We are spoilt with engines in Bucyrus and Ruston, where most steam trains and traction engines only have a single engine, the ruston has five, and the Bycyrus has six!

### Main drive engine

Located just in front of the boiler. Two massive pistons turn the main drive, which can be engaged to the winch to lift the bucket, or the wheels to move the whole machine along the caterpillar tracks. This engine is controlled with the main throttle as well as the forward and reverse control which changes the order that the inlet valves are opened.

### Clutch

Located behind the driver, on the left of the main winch gear. Instead of driver having to throw their whole weight just to engage the clutch on the winch, their control makes a steam powered piston engage it.

### Slew engine

Located to the right of the driver, this engine turns the whole body above the tracks. Controlled with a single forward and reverse throttle.

### Racking engine

Located on the tower thing, this engine turns a rack and pinion to move the dipper arm in and out.

### Steam pump

The last engine is in a steam water pump to the left of the boiler. This pumps water from the tank under the floor, through a water heater, and into the boiler.

### Steam Injector

Located to the right of the boiler  
Similar to an engine, the steam injector uses steam directly to draw water into the boiler. See [Steam Ejector Working](https://chemicalengineeringworld.com/steam-ejector-working-types-parts/) by Chemical Engineering World  
Unlike most, the Ruston's injector uses a single valve to control the water and steam.
