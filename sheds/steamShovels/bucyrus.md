# Bucyrus

The No.2 Bucyrus is Lake Goldsmith's rail-mounted steam shovel, manufactured in 1903 by The Bucyrus Co., South Milwaukee.<sup>[1]</sup> It is listed on the Victorian Heritage Database, file number [B7065](http://vhd.heritage.vic.gov.au/search/nattrust_result_detail/68146).

The shovel was used in Queensland at Mount Morgan gold mine (1903-1908) before moving to Rockhampton for harbour construction (1908-c.1923), and then to the Brisbane sewer project (c.1923-?). By 1927 the shovel was at Fyansford after being purchased by Australian Portland Cement for use in its expanding limestone quarry, and given the designation No.2. The shovel was retired during the 1960s and remained at the quarry  
It is the oldest known steam shovel, and the only example of its design, in Australia. The shovel was one of the first to be imported into Australia as part of an increase in mining activity, and mechanisation of mining. It is one of only a few examples in the world made by one of the largest suppliers of this type of shovel, the Bucyrus Company, Milwaukee, USA, which supplied the majority of the shovels used on the Panama Canal. It is the only example of its type in Australia, and the only known example outside America.<sup>[1]</sup>

## Controls

The main driver has a break at their feet and - from left to right - main throttle, wheel clutch, blow through, slew, main drive direction, and winch clutch. The rack driver has just the rack control.

### Break

At the main driver's feet is the winch break. It has serrations so it can be held in the engaged position

### Main drive throttle

Top left handle, forwards is open, back is closed

### Wheel clutch

Bottom left handle, down is disengaged, up is engaged.  
Moves a dog clutch to connect the main drive to the wheels

### Blow though

Short lever fourth from the right, forward or backward are open, mid is closed.  
Opens the blowthrough valves on the main and slew engines

### Slew

Third lever from the right, forwards is left, mid is neutral, backwards is right.  
Has a pin to hold it in the mid position

### Main drive direction

Lever second from the right, forwards will winch up the bucket or drive forwards when the wheels are engaged, middle is neutral, backwards is reverse.  
Can be used to make even finer throttle adjustment

### Winch clutch

Right most lever, forwards is engaged.  
Controls a steam powered piston which actually applies the clutch

### Rack

Next to the second driver's seat under the dipper arm. This is the only control that's not in the main cab.  
Forwards moves the dipper arm out, mid is neutral, back moves in, and racking the dipper arm all the way out opens the bucket.  

## Engines

We are spoilt with engines in Bucyrus and Ruston, where most steam trains and traction engines only have a single engine, the ruston has five, and the Bycyrus has six!

### Main drive engine

Located to the right, in front of the boiler. Two massive pistons turn the main drive, which can be engaged to the winch to lift the bucket, or the wheels to move the whole machine along the track. This engine is controlled with the main throttle as well as the forward and reverse control which changes the order that the inlet valves are opened.

### Clutch

Located just behind the main driver, to the right of main winch gear. Instead of driver having to throw their whole weight just to engage the clutch on the  winch, their control makes a steam powered piston engage it.

### Slew engine

Located to the left in front of the boiler, this engine turns the whole arm, with the second driver on it. Controlled with a single forward and reverse throttle.

### Racking engine

Located on the tower thing, this engine turns a rack and pinion to move the dipper arm in and out. Different from the others, this engine isn't controlled from the main cab, but from a seat on the slew platform. It's blow through valves are separate from the cab control, instead it has six valves in front of the control lever.

### Steam pumps

The last two engines are in the two redundant steam water pumps to the right of the boiler. These pump water from the tanks under the floor into the boiler.

### Steam Injector

Located near the back and to the right of the boiler  
Similar to an engine, the steam injector uses steam directly to draw water into the boiler. See [Steam Ejector Working](https://chemicalengineeringworld.com/steam-ejector-working-types-parts/) by Chemical Engineering World

## Steaming up

1. Put in bottom bungs (with lube) TODO: Which lube?
2. Close bottom drain valve
3. Add 3L of 486 boiler treatment in the top bung hole
4. Fill water to bottom of gauge glass. IF YOU LIGHT THE FIRE FIRST IT WILL MELT THROUGH THE BOTTOM ON THE BOILER
5. Light the fire
   1. Make sure to fill under the door, where you can't see unless you stick your head in
   2. Open the air intake by pulling up the chain below the fire box door
   3. While the fire is going
      1. Make sure there are no gaps with no wood where cold air can get through
      2. Always keep the door closed unless your putting wood in, even close it while you walk between the door and wood pile
      3. Close the air intake when you add wood, or you'll lose some hair
6. Oil everything
   1. Bearing oil (Grey tub & tomato bottles) goes in:
      1. Cups, points & reservoirs
   2. Steam oil (Brown tub & bbq bottle) goes in:
      1. Hydrostatic & mechanical lubricators
7. Wait for steam to come out of the top bung hole
8. Put in top bung
9. Make sure the main steam output valve is closed
10. Set controls
    1. Disengage wheels
    2. Engage break
    3. Disengage clutch
    4. Close main throttle
    5. Main drive to neutral
    6. Slew to neutral
11. Wait for the pressure gauge to reach around 90psi
12. Open all blow through valves
13. Open rack, slew, and clutch steam valves
14. Crack open the main valve till you hear steam moving
15. Open the main drive throttle and let it turn slowley
16. Wait until no more water comes out the blowthroughs
17. Close the main throttle
18. Open the main valve the rest of the way
19. Slowley move each engine, to warm them & blow out water
    1. The rack can be done whenever the second driver is ready
    2. Start with the clutch
    3. Then winch up the bucket
    4. Slew to each side & make sure the jacks are planted
20. Play with your digger!

## Running

### Fire man

Possibly the most important job, the fireman is in charge of keeping the fire going by adding wood, and managing the air intake to run the fire at the right heat to keep the pressure up, as well as keeping the water topped off using the steam injector, and the steam pumps.

### Digging

The main driver slews to where they will dig and then drops the bucket, slowing it as it nears the bottom with the break. The second driver pushes the bucket into the ground with the rack, stopping it just before it hits body, they then apply full throttle forwards as the main driver lifts the bucket with the winch, filling the bucket. The second driver racks in the dipper arm so as to not open the bucket early, as the bucket is winched up and slewed over, then the arm is racked all the way out to open the bucket and drop the load.

### Moving along the tracks

TODO

## Packing up

1. Close the main steam valve, but leave the individual engine valves open
2. Open all blow through valves
3. Wait for the fire to go out
4. Open the bottom drain valve
5. Remove the top bung
6. Once the boiler is empty, remove the four bottom bungs
