# Bucyrus

## Controls

### Rack

Next to the second driver's seat under the dipper arm.  
Forwards moves the dipper arm out, mid is neutral, back moves in, and racking the dipper arm all the way out opens the bucket.  
Controls the racking engine, which moves the dipper arm in and out. This is the only control that's not in the main cab.

### Winch clutch

Right most lever, forwards is engaged.  
Controls a steam powered piston which actually applies the clutch

### Main drive direction

Lever second from the right, forwards will winch up the bucket or drive forwards when the wheels are engaged, middle is neutral, backwards is reverse.  
Can be used to make even finer throttle adjustment

### Slew

Third lever from the right, forwards is left, mid is neutral, backwards is right.  
Has a pin to hold it in the mid position

### Main drive throttle

Top left handle, forwards is open, back is closed

### Wheel clutch

Bottom left handle, down is disengaged, up is engaged.  
Moves a dog clutch to connect the main drive to the wheels

### Blow though

Short lever fourth from the right, forward or backward are open, mid is closed.  
Opens the blowthrough valves on the main and slew engines

## Engines

We are spoilt with engines in Bucyrus and Ruston, where most steam trains and traction engines only have a single engine, we have six\!

### Main drive engine

Located to the right, in front of the boiler. Two massive pistons turn the main drive, which can be engaged to the winch to lift the bucket, or the wheels to move the whole machine along the track. This engine is controlled with the main throttle as well as the forward and reverse control which changes the order that the inlet valves are opened.

### Clutch

Located just behind the main driver, to the right of main winch gear. Instead of driver having to throw their whole weight just to engage the clutch on the  winch, their control makes a steam powered piston engage it.

### Slew engine

Located to the left in front of the boiler, this engine turns the whole arm, with the second driver on it. Controlled with a single forward and reverse throttle.

### Racking engine

Located on the tower thing, this engine turns a rack and pinion to move the dipper arm in and out. Different from the others, this engine isn't controlled from the main cab, but from a seat on the slew platform. It's blow through valves are wish separate from the can control, instead of has six valves in front of the control lever.

### Steam pumps

The last two engines are in the two redundant steam water pumps to the right of the boiler. These pump water from the tanks under the floor into the boiler.

## Steaming up

1. Put in bottom bungs (with lube) \#\#\#\#\#  
2. Close blow down valve  
3. Add 3L of 486 boiler treatment in the top bung hole  
4. Fill water to bottom of gauge glass. IF YOU LIGHT THE FIRE FIRST IT WILL MELT THROUGH THE BOTTOM ON THE BOILER  
5. Light the fire  
   1. Make sure to fill under the door, where you can't see unless you stick your head in  
   2. Open the air intake by pulling up the chain below the fire box door  
   3. While the fire is going  
      1. Make sure there are no gaps with no wood where cold air can get through
      2. Always keep the door closed unless your putting wood in, even close it while you walk between the door and wood pile  
      3. Close the air intake when you add wood, or you'll lose some hair  
6. Oil everything  
   1. Bearing oil (Grey tub & tomato bottles) goes in:  
      1. Cups, points & reservoirs  
   2. Steam oil (Brown tub & bbq bottle) goes in:  
      1. Hydrostatic & mechanical lubricators  
7. Wait for steam to come out of the top bung hole  
8. Put in top bung  
9. Make sure the main steam output valve is closed  
10. Set controls  
    1. Disengage wheels  
    2. Engage break  
    3. Disengage clutch  
    4. Close main throttle  
    5. Main drive to neutral  
    6. Slew to neutral  
11. Wait for the pressure gauge to reach around 90psi  
12. Open all blow through valves  
13. Open rack, slew, and clutch steam valves  
14. Crack open the main valve till you hear steam moving  
15. Open the main drive throttle and let it turn slowley  
16. Wait until no more water comes out the blowthroughs  
17. Close the main throttle  
18. Open the main valve the rest of the way  
19. Slowley move each engine, to warm them & blow out water  
    1. The rack can be done whenever the second driver is ready  
    2. Start with the clutch  
    3. Then winch up the bucket  
    4. Slew to each side & make sure the jacks are planted  
20. Play with your digger\!

## Running

### Fire man

Possibly the most important job, the fireman is in charge of keeping the fire going by adding wood, and managing the air intake to run the fire at the right heat to keep the pressure up, as well as keeping the water topped off using the steam injector, and the steam pumps.

### Digging

The main driver slews to where they will dig and then drops the bucket, slowing it as it nears the bottom with the break. The second driver pushes the bucket into the ground with the rack, stopping it just before it hits body, they then apply full throttle forwards as the main driver lifts the bucket with the winch, filling the bucket. The second driver racks in the dipper arm so as to not open the bucket early, as the bucket is winched up and slewed over, then the arm is racked all the way out to open the bucket and drop the load.

### Moving along the tracks

## Packing up

1. Close the main steam valve, but leave the individual engine valves open  
2. Open all blow through valves  
3. Wait for the fire to go out  
4. Open
